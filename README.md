# ECE 211 Final Project
Living a healthy lifestyle can help individuals prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. As the fast-paced living rate increases, people give a lot of emphasis on health and lifestyle. Due to monopoly pricing, prescription drugs are expensive, and people prefer to remain healthy rather than get cured. So to reduce suffering and medical costs, the health monitor system is designed. Health monitors are equipped with different sensors that allow us to read the user’s heartbeat in real-time, and are used in some of the most popular products of today’s world: Apple Watch and Fitbit. In this project, we are using an FPGA in order to design a health monitor module.

The specifications of the health monitor system include:-
● A pulse monitor that reads the heartbeat of its user every 5 seconds.
● A seven-segment monitor to display the average measured heartbeat.
● A reaction timer to indicate the time in the seven-segment display.
● An option for the user to toggle between two modes via a switch: reaction timer or pulse counter to present simple controls such as a start, enter, reset, and LED signals.

The technical report will examine the operation of the health monitor by first exploring the high-level organization and then individual submodules.
